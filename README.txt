This is a coworker requested Python script that will perform the following:

-install a torrenting application (maybe just Transmission)
-Start the Torrenting application
-Add any number of Torrent files
-Start the Torrents
-Pause the Torrents
-Delete the Torrents
-Close the TOrrenting application

Side notes:
-This will probably all be running in a VM behind various Routers
-It must be all terminal
-Ideally, the program will monitor the Torrents bandwidth usage in some capacity
----The bandwidth usage will probably need to be compared to values on the Router to highlight discrepancies.
